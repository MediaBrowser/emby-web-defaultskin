# emby-skin-mentasm

This is an edit of the default skin for Emby Theater. 

# Installation

Install into the app by installing a plugin from a url. The url is: http://mentasm.github.io/emby-skin-mentasm/package.json.  Can be installed in ET client or using http://tv.emby.media if you would like to test witholut effecting your client.

# Changes

Altered number of tiles on movie and tv home pages
Removed continue watching section from TV as next up shows progress bars below thumb images
Modified spotlight tiles to display latest 6 unwatched TV shows or movies.  (TV shows currently broken as unwatched sorting is broken in ET)


# Like to change
Would like to create a similar home page for Trailers that would enable latest unwatched trailers to be displayed in a spotlight.
